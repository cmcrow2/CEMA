      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>
        We are a small group of civil and software engineers, who were annoyed
        at having to flip through hundreds of pages of information overload to
        find the exact graph or equation we needed for a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        With AI advancing quicker than anyone would have thought, our engineers
        at C.E.M.A. (&quot;see-muh&quot;) came up with an idea to use this new
        technology to steeply shorten the workload for every civil engineer.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We are currently designing and building an AI to be a Civil
        Engineer&apos;s personal assistant. Once provided with any formal manual
        (like the American Institute of Steel Construction for example), our AI
        will be able to read, understand, and answer user questions about the
        document. Simply upload your manual, then ask your assistant any
        questions you have!

        Since we are currently in the early stages of development, we are only
        working on this project part time. With your feedback, we would be able
